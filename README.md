# The robot simulator

It's small project created to simulate a robot tabletop.

I've submitted it as part of an interview.

## Solution

In order to conform with the requirements, my solution was to create two classes:

`Tabletop` and `Robot`, which can simulate a robot moving on a tabletop and turning left and right.

## Techonology Stack

- Ruby

## Dependencies

- RSpec

## Running the test data

    bin/the_robot_simulator <file>

Eg.:

    bin/the_robot_simulator test_data/a
    bin/the_robot_simulator test_data/b
    bin/the_robot_simulator test_data/c
